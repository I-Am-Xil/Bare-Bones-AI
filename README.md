# Bare Bones AI

Basicaly, i'm learning to program AI and since python AI tutorials look just like black magic of higher level than mine. I decided to learn to code it in C just to get a better grasp of what is going on under the hood. I'm following the streams from [Tsoding Daily's](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily) Youtube channel.

I reformat a bit his code since passing complete structures to functions is not of my liking (Pointers are our friends) and i also append to his models what i end up reading in the reasearch papers i find around the web.

Once i'm more confortable with my knowledge i'll change to python, write some more C libraries, make a full blown project with the model written in assembly, TSQL or BrainFuck; or i might just change my interest and forget i even did this to begin with. Who knows.

I haven't written C code in ages. So i'm sorry for any hardcore C programer's eyes i hurt in the process of making this repo.
